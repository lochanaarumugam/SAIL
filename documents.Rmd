## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

-   <div>

    ```{r Sports Analysis by Conference}

    # Calculate the winning percentage for each team (W=WON, G=Played)
    data <- mutate(data, win_pct = W / G)

    # Create a bar plot showing the number of games won by each team
    #W=WON, G=Played
    ggplot(data, aes(x = TEAM, y = G)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      xlab("Team") +
      ylab("Games Won")


    # Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between offensive efficiency and power rating
    # ADJOE=offensive_efficiency, BARTHAG=power_rating
    ggplot(data, aes(x = ADJOE, y = BARTHAG)) +
      geom_point() +
      xlab("Offensive Efficiency") +
      ylab("Power Rating")

    # Calculate the correlation between offensive efficiency and power rating
    cor(data$ORB, data$BARTHAG)

    # By Efficiency 



    # Summarize data by conference
    conference_summary <- data %>%
      group_by(CONF) %>%
      summarize(mean_power_rating = mean(BARTHAG),
                mean_off_reb_rate = mean(ORB),
                mean_win_percentage = mean(win_pct),
                mean_off_eff = mean(ADJOE),
                mean_turnover_rate = mean(TOR),
                mean_ft_rate = mean(FTR),
                mean_fg2_pct = mean(X2P_O),
                mean_fg3_pct = mean(X3P_O))

    # View the summary data
    #print(conference_summary)

    # Plot win percentage by conference
    ggplot(conference_summary, aes(x = CONF, y = mean_win_percentage)) +
      geom_col() +
      xlab("Conference") +
      ylab("Win Percentage")

    # Plot offensive efficiency rating by conference
    ggplot(conference_summary, aes(x = CONF, y = mean_off_reb_rate)) +
      geom_col() +
      xlab("Conference") +
      ylab("Offencive Efficiency")

    ```

    </div>

```{r Top 3 most powerful teams}
# Create training and test sets
# Find top 3 most powerful teams
most_powerful_teams <- data %>% 
  top_n(3, BARTHAG) %>% 
  select(TEAM) %>% 
  pull()

# Print top 3 most powerful teams
most_powerful_teams

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Prediction based on Winrate vs 2points}
# Create training and test sets

set.seed(123)
train_index <- createDataPartition(data$W, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train_data <- data[train_index, ]
test_data <- data[-train_index, ]
# Fit linear regression model
model <- lm(W ~ X2P_O, data = train_data)

# Predict on test data
predictions <- predict(model, test_data)

# Calculate mean squared error
mse <- mean((predictions - test_data$W)^2)

# Print mean squared error
mse
 

# Plot predictions vs. actual values
ggplot(test_data, aes(x =W, y = predictions)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  xlab("Actual values") +
  ylab("Predictions")
```
